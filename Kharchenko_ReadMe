Abstract:
    We present a list of 3006 Milky Way Stellar Clusters (MWSC), found in
    the 2MAst (2MASS with Astrometry) catalogue. The target list was
    compiled on the basis of present-day lists of open, globular and
    candidate clusters. For confirmed clusters we determined a homogeneous
    set of astrophysical parameters such as membership, angular radii of
    the main morphological parts, mean cluster proper motions, distances,
    reddenings, ages, tidal parameters, and sometimes radial velocities.

Description:
    An all-sky target list of 3784 entries with initial cluster parameters
    was compiled from sources available in the literature. As the primary
    source we used the data from the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data (COCD,
    Kharchenko et al. 2005a,b, Cat. J/A+A/438/1163, J/A+A/440/403). For
    further optical clusters the data were taken from the Dias et al.
    (2002, Cat. B/ocl) list (Version 3.1, 24/nov/2010). Known associations
    were retrieved from Melnik & Dambis (2009, Cat. J/MNRAS/400/518). For
    clusters detected in the NIR the information came from Bica et al.
    (2003b, Cat. J/A+A/404/223), Dutra et al. (2003,
    Cat. J/A+A/400/533), Froebrich et al. (2007, Cat. J/MNRAS/374/399).
    Globular clusters were selected from the catalogue by Harris (1996,
    edition 2010, 2010arXiv1012.3224H). Additionally, we incorporated
    supplementary data on embedded clusters from Bica et al. (2003a, Cat.
    J/A+A/397/177), Lada & Lada (2003ARA&A..41...57L) and on stars in
    associations from Humphreys (1978, Cat. V/44).

    The basic stellar data were taken from the all-sky catalogue 2MAst
    (2Mass with Astrometry), that was extracted from the all-sky
    catalogues PPMXL (Roeser et al. 2010, Cat. I/317) and 2MASS (Cutri et
    al. 2003, Cat. II/246). Additionally, we incorporated data on radial
    velocities from Kharchenko et al. (2007, Cat. III/254) and spectral
    types from ASCC-2.5 (Kharchenko & Roeser 2009, Cat. I/280).

    Around each object from our target list we defined a circular area
    with a radius of ra=r2+radd where r2 is the cluster radius, and
    radd=0.3{deg}. In these areas we selected in 2MAst only those stars
    with flags Rflg (the 2nd triple of the flags in 2MASS) set to 1, 2, or
    3 in each band, i.e. the stars with the best quality detections in
    photometric and astrometric data.

    There are 3784 targets in our object list, we confirmed 3006 clusters
    and/or associations. These 3006 sky areas contain about 63.5 mln 2MAst
    stars with best quality detections in photometric and astrometric
    data. We selected about 0.14 mln most probable members located in the
    central cluster regions and determined - with a homogeneous
    method/pipeline - angular sizes of the main morphological parts,
    heliocentric distances, colour-excesses, mean proper motions, ages,
    tidal parameters, sometimes radial velocities and metallicities.

    We present for the Milky Way:

    The Catalogue of the MWSC Data with:
      Catalogue of parameters for confirmed clusters;
      Index (full list) of MWSC objects;
      Notes (full object list with notes);
      Inside each list the entries are sorted by MWSC numbers (i.e. right
      ascension J2000 from the target list).

    The Catalogues of the MWSC Stars in 3006 circular sky areas with
      classified clusters. Files are sorted by MWSC numbers; inside each sky
      area the entries are sorted by Ks magnitudes.

    The Atlas of MWSC diagrams.
      In the Atlas, the Cluster pages are sorted by MWSC numbers.

Description of files: atlas/*

    For each cluster we prepared two EPS-pages with diagrams:
     Page 1 contains the cluster map as the basic panel
     (file MWSC_Name_map.eps.gz),
     Page 2 contains the Ks,(J-Ks) and Ks,(J-H) CMDs as basic panels
     (file MWSC_Name_cmd.eps.gz).

    The legend on each page gives the cluster name, MWSC number, (COCD
    number); equatorial RAJ2000, DecJ2000, and galactic l, b coordinates
    of the cluster centre; apparent cluster sizes r0, r1, r2, [number of
    1sigma-members within the corresponding radius]; weighted average
    components PM_(X,Y) of proper motion with their rms errors, [number of
    stars used to compute the average]; the average radial velocity, RV
    with their rms error, [the number of stars used to compute the
    average]; distance to the cluster, d, distance modulus, (Ks-M_Ks);
    NIR colour-excesses, E(J-H), E(J-Ks), interstellar extinction, A(Ks);
    cluster age, its rms error, [the number of stars used to compute the
    average age, or it is -1 if a manual isochrone fit was applied].
    Additionally we show in the 2nd pages: an empirical correction
    Delta_H for a better isochrone fit in the K_s,(J-H) diagram.

    Symbols and their colours have the same meaning in all plots. Stars
    are shown as coloured circles or dots. Cyan symbols mark stars outside
    the cluster radius r2, green symbols are stars within r2. The most
    probable kinematic and photometric members (1sigma-members) are
    indicated in black, red, or blue. Black is for members located within
    r1 (the visible radius of the central part), red for members between
    r1 and r2, and blue for stars outside r2 (the probabilities are
    formal). Cyan bars show the uncertainty for 1sigma-members.

Description of files MWSC_Name_map.eps.gz (Page 1):

   Page 1 contains five diagrams with spatial information.
   The right panel is a map of the cluster neighbourhood (MAP),
   the left panels show (from top to bottom) relations depending on the
   distance from the cluster centre, r, for:
   -magnitude Ks (Ks vs. r),
   -proper motions (PM vs. r),
   -density profile diagram (DPD).

   MAP:
    Stars are displayed as small circles.
    The circle size corresponds to the stellar magnitude ranged in six
    Ks mag intervals:
    < 6.0, 6.0 - 8.0, 8.0 - 10.0, 10.0 - 12.0, 12.0 - 14.0, > 14.0.
    Blue cross : cluster centre selected in this study;
    Blue plus : cluster centre from the literature;
    Magenta pluses : centres of other clusters (from target list) visible
                      (if any) in the map;
    Dotted blue large circle : cluster core border (r0);
    Solid blue large circle : inner cluster border (r1);
    Dashed blue large circle : cluster corona border (r2).

   The left panels:
   Blue vertical dotted, solid, dashed lines  mark r0, r1, r2, respectively.

   PM vs. r: Magenta  horizontal lines correspond to the average proper
   motion of the cluster determined in this paper;

   DPD: Density profiles (Log of Number of stars per 1 sq.deg) are shown for
   all stars (green line), 3sigma-members (blue line), 2sigma-members (magenta
   line) and 1sigma-members (black line).

Description of files MWSC_Name_cmd.eps.gz (Page 2):

   Page 2 contains diagrams with kinematic and photometric information.
   The three left panels are:
    -two PM_(X,Y) vs. Ks relations, i.e. PM-magnitude equation diagrams (MEDs);
    -the vector point diagram of proper motions (VPD).
   The two upper right panels are:
    -relations (Ks,(J-H) and Ks,(J-Ks), i.e. the colour-magnitude
      diagrams (CMDs).
   The bottom right panels:
    -colour-colour diagrams (CCDs);
    -reddening-independent parameter Q-colour diagrams (QCDs).

   The CCDs and QCDs are separated into two subpanels (as well as CMDs and
   MEDs are separated into two parts via a broken line). The division is
   made with respect to the Ks_mc magnitude: in the bottom subpanels we
   place data for Ks>Ks_mc, in the upper ones - for Ks<Ks_mc, where
   Ks_mc is Ks-magnitude at the bluest colour (J-Ks) of the isochrone
   closest to the determined cluster age.

  CMDs:
   Magenta curve: the apparent isochrone closest to the determined cluster age;
   Solid blue lines: left and right borders of a domain of 100% photometric
                      cluster members;
   Solid red lines: ZAMS and TAMS (shown only in the Ks,(J-Ks) diagram), the
                     borders of the evolved Main Sequence stars;
   Magenta dashed line: corresponds to the Ks_mc;
   Thick yellow circles: stars selected for age determination;
   Black arrows: increasing interstellar extinction vectors.

  MED:
   Magenta solid lines correspond to the average proper motion of the
    cluster; the magenta dashed line corresponds to the Ks_mc.

  CCD and QCD:
   The Magenta curve corresponds to the apparent isochrone (observed magnitudes
   and colours); the cyan curve corresponds to the intrinsic isochrone.

Note (G5): This column has the following meaning:
  "=" = cluster parameters are determined
  ":" = possibly this is a cluster, but parameters are not determined
  "-" = this is not a cluster
  "&" = duplicated/coincides with other cluster

  * 07-Nov-2013: Original version
  * 06-Feb-2014: in the Byte-by-byte description of the catalog,
       the error on the proper motion was assigned to the RA component;
       it concerns both components
