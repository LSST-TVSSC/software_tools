Collection of generically useful software developed by TVS members

Caveat emptor!  These tools are shared in the hopes they are generally useful, and they are tested in good faith by their
developers.  However, all users are responsible for ensuring the codes perform properly for their 
specific use case.  You are welcome to adapt them for your own purposes, but please understand the authors cannot formally 
support the software and may offer help on a best-efforts basis only.
